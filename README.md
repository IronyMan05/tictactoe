Introduction:
This is a simple command line implementation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe written in Java. 
It is a two-player game where each player takes turns placing either an 'X' or an 'O' on a 3x3 board. 
The winner is the first player to get three in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
If no player achieves three in a row and all the spaces on the board are filled, the game is a draw.
